This repository contains the code for parsimonious inertial microcavitation rheology (pIMR). Data from laser-induced cavitation experiments in soft hydrogels and liquids are post-processed to inversely characterize the material viscoelasticity. 

In brief, we seek to minimize a cost function within the space of trial viscoelastic parameters. The cost function describes the agreement between the experimentally measured bubble collapse time $t_{\rm c}^{\rm Expt}$ and an approximate collapse $t_{c}^{EB}$ corresponding to a set of viscoelastic parameters.

For detail, please refer to our paper: Zhu*, Remillard*, Abeid, Frolkin, Bryngelson, Yang, Rodriguez & Estrada. "Parsimonious inertial cavitation rheometry via bubble collapse time", (*under review*, 2025).
